## SVG and Canvas
----

- SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics. SVG is essentially to graphics what HTML is to text.
- Canvas: Added in HTML5, the HTML `<canvas>` element can be used to draw graphics via scripting in JavaScript.
